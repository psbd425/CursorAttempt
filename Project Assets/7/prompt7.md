I had a pause of a few hours after complting the 6th prompt. I just wanted to study if this pause impacted the agent in any way.

The app is looking in a good shape now. Let's work on adding some new UI cleanup. I want you to make the app with two columns, where the first column has all the user input aspects, and the second column does the displaying of the people and their availability. Also, organize the people in a grid that updates the positioning of people as I keep adding new people. For example, when there is a single person, the person should appear at the center of the second column. When I then add a second person, the space in the second column should be divided for these two people.
