This is looking good. Now, I want you to focus on the people clock tiles. One thing I am noticing is that the size of the tiles are not uniform. Let's make sure that all the tiles for people clock are the same size.

This is looking great. Now, I want you to make sure that once I am adding new people, the size of the app should not be changing. Let's keep the overall size of the app fixed. So, when I add people, let's try to accomodate them all within the rectangle space of the app that is available. Feel free to put the tiles adjacent vertically as well as horizontally. Also, feel free to reduce the size of all the tiles once we keep adding new people.

This is very close to my requirement. You did great in terms of using all the available space for the single person added. Also, you've done a great job in resizing the tile with new person added. However, with more people added, I see that the tile is unnecessarily taller. And, any new people added to the app are being lost underneath the first person. Let's look at the overall available space and the number of people to accomodate and calculate the position for each tile correctly.

This is getting closer. I see with each new person added, you are resizing the tiles. Few issues still remain. First, when only one person is added, the outer rectangular boundary for the person tile is smaller on the right than the clock. Let's fix this. Second, I am still not seeing all the people tile. It seems the tiles are only being added to bottom of previous tile. Make sure the space on the right of each clock is also used to place all the tiles. There might be some small number miscalculations. Let's think more carefully to get the numbers right. It's okay to have some extra spaces, but make sure all the tiles are visible. 

This isn't still working. Make sure you are using the outer size of the tile to estimate the placement of the tiles. Feel free to take your time to correct this issue.

With this prompt, the agent seemed to be thinking and came up with a plan. This was close. Worked well for just 2 tiles, but once the 3rd tile was added, the tile kept dancing between the first row third column and second row first column. I asked agent to try and fix it.

You are getting closer. This is working well for the first and second person. However, once I add third person, this is causing the third tile to dance between the first row third column (which is outside of the view) and second row first column. Make sure you calculate the positions correctly, and resize the tiles so as to accomodate all of them within the available space.

The problem persists. Think more carefully in your calculations.

This didn't solve the problem. Here are some potential issue that you might have to think well: 
1. The tile needs to be placed as a whole unit. Don't think of placing some part of the tile on one row while the other part in next row.
2. Make sure you resize all the tiles before you try to place a new tile. Meaning, make sure you calculate the new sizes for all the tiles, before attempting to put a new tile. For this you'd need to consider the number of tiles that are alreay in there, as well as the new tile that you are planning to put. 
Let's think about the problem more deeply and come up with a solution.

You are still having the same issue. Here are two screenshots of  see what your current state is. The app is currently moving from one screenshot to another every second. Maybe this is related to the clock second calculation as well. Let's try to find the issue and resolve it.

This seems to have resolve the issue on columns.

This is heading towards the right direction. Now, the issue with column seems to have resolved. But the tiles on the second row  are cut off on the bottom. Let's look at this and try to fix it. Here's a screenshot that demonstrates the problem. 

Now, you are not using the second row at all, every new person is being added on the first row itself. Here's a screenshot. You were heading to the right direction earlier. I think you only needed to decrease the size of the tiles when you had to place the new tile so that the bottom of the lower row wasn't cut off. Let's work on it from the previous state.

This didn't resolve the issue. You are not ading the tiles to the second row at all. (I added a screenshot as well).

**
The agent strugged to get it right or maybe I strugged to steer it to the right direction. So, I decided to go back to the previous state.
