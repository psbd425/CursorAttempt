This is looking good now. Let's work on a feature where we can update the busy hours for each individual users. Feel free to suggest approaches to tackle this in terms of how this can be part of the UI. A few ideas are:
1. Add a button on the left panel of the app where after typing a name of a person, I can click on a button to retrieve his busy slots. I can then add new slot or remove the existing slot for this user.
2. I can click on the person tile, this then brings a new set of UI Components on the Add Person Section where it lists the current busy slots, that I can modify or delete as well as presents me with an opportunity to add new busy slots.
