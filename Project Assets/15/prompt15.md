This is looking great. Now, let's add a few minor updates to the circular clocks. Can you work on adding the hour ticks indicating the 12 hours inside the clock. Also, if it makes sense, add the numbers indicating each hour inside the clocks. Feel free to keep these ticks minimal. Also, feel free to increase the size of clocks if need be to include the ticks and numbers.

A few more additional tweaks to the clocks.

This is starting to look even better. The individual people clock are looking okay, I will ask for more on them later. But, for the user's local time clock, the outer circumference and the dots are not placed properly. I see that the dots go outside of the circumference for the numbers on the left of the clock, whereas they are inside the circumference for the numbers on the right. Make sure they are even throughout. 

This is looking better. Maybe there's something you'd need to do for the clock itself, leaving the dots for now. It seems the inner border of the outer circumference of the clock is not uniform. Please check that, and correct it so that the inner border is uniformly placed inside the outer circumference creating a small ring like structure.
