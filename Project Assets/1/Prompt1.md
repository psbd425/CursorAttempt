 want you to create a JavaScript/HTML/CSS app that tracks if multiple people entered by a user are busy or available. The app should be written in pure JavaScript and can be run on a browser. While working on this project, I want you to work on this project such that you can integrate this app with MATLAB so that app can run in MATLAB. Feel free to consult MATLAB documentation for this. So, here are the requiremnts:
1. The app should have an interface where a user can add his/her people (relatives) and their country. 
2. In the interface, a user should also be able to add busy slots for the people.
3. The app should display clocks with time for each individual people.
4. The clock in the app should show if a person is busy or not. A person is busy if the current time in the person's time zone is  in his/her busy slot.
5. The app should be able to update the people, their time, and their status in real time, after a user adds a person.
6. The interface to add user and their country, and their busy slot should be always available.  
7. The app should also show the time of the user based on the current time zone he is in.
