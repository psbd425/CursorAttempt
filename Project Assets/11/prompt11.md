This is looking good. Now, I want you to update the clocks on 'People clocks' section. Let's use circular analog clocks, instead of digital ones. Again, keep the clocks minimal in design, but with all the 3 hands (hour, minute, and seconds), seconds being updated every second as expected in an analog clock. Also, make sure you still continue to indicate the availability in the clock with use of colors (green for available, red for busy) for the clock background.
