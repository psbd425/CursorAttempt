This is looking good. Now, one more addition related to the clocks. Let's add the analog clock also for the user's current local time.

This caused both digital an analog clock to be displayed. So, I asked the agent to remove the digital clock for the current user, and keep the clock left aligned.

This is looking good. Let's give a different color (possibly yellow) for the current user's local clock. Also, make sure there is only the analog clock for the current user. And, make it aligned to the left of the column, instead of the current center alignment. While adding these UI changes, make sure the functionality of the project still continues.

The agent updated the request. And I made a few more requests.

This is looking really great. One little modification is around the vertical space after the user's local clock. Remove some extra space from there and increase the clock size by a little so that the user clock is just a big bigger than the other people clocks.

There's still some empty vertical space after the user clock, make sure you remove it so that there is little less space between the clock and the 'Add Person' section.

Remove the spacing further.

There is still more space than required. Remove the space further.
