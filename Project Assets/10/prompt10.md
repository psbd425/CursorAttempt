This now looks good visually. Now, let's come to the second issue that has happened. The app logic when a person is added seems to be broken again. After I 'Add Person', the person is not appearing in the 'People Clocks' section. Feel free to look back at your previous corrections for a similar issue and reason more on what could be going wrong again. Work to fix this issue. 

**
The AI worked on adding a diagnostics on people array, and asked me if the array is empty after I 'add person'. I checked it and found that the array is still empty, and replied that. It then added another diagnostic message, 'app.js loaded' and asked me to see if this is seen in the console. I responded, and the agent went on to work on a different approach. It asked me if I was providing all the inputs. 
**

I see 'Add Person Submit' console log after I click on the 'Add Person' button. Also, it seems the 'People Clock' is populated after I add a busy slot. So, the logic we want to implement is that a busy slot is not required. In other words, it should be okay to add a person without a busy slot. Update the code to make sure this is true. 

**
The agent didn't quite fix the issue so I had to ask it again
**

I am still getting 'No busy slot added yet' message. Make sure you verify that zero or many busy slots are okay for adding people.

The agent seem to have fixed the issue.
