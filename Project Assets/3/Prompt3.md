This is looking good. I want you to now think about better way to represent the busy slot selection for the user. Can we use some other ui component, maybe a slider to select the start and end time for the time slot. Also, I want you to enable adding the busy time slot synchronously as I am adding the person details. This means to say I should be able to add busy slot while I am adding a new person.
