I like the way you have added the option to add multiple busy slots. Let's keep the functionality as it. But, let's use a button with text '+' for 'add busy slot'. Meanwhile the section for 'People Clocks' is still broken, it is not displaying the people that have already been added, after 'Add Person' button has been clicked. Feel free to look at your code and reason on why this is broken, and attempt to fix it.
