This is looking great. Now, I want you to work on an option to filter people. I want you to add a section in the UI where I can select all the users based on the following 3 criteria:
1. All the people that are busy.
2. All the people that are available.
3. All the people that were added. 
Based on the selection among the 3 options, the list of people and the clocks should be updated to reflect the choice. Feel free to ask me questions if you are not understanding this new requirement.
